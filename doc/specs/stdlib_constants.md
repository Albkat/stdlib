## Introduction


The [[stdlib_constants]] module provides mathematical constants and the most common physical constants.

The [[stdlib_codata]] module defines all codata constants as derived type [[codata_constant]].
The lastest codata constants were released in 2018 by the [NIST](http://physics.nist.gov/constants.)
The names are quite long and can be aliased with shorter names.


## Example

```fortran
{!example/constants/example_constants.f90!}
```
