## Introduction

`stdlib_constants` module provides mathematical and physical constants. 
The latter are the last codata constants (2018) taken from [NIST](http://physics.nist.gov/constants.)

## Procedures and Methods provided


The constants are implemented as double precision parameters for Fortran 
The names are quite long and you can alias them for shorter names



## Example

```fortran
{!example/constants/example_constants.f90!}
```
